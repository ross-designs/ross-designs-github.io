									<h1>Adapting to Change</h1>
									<p>Imagine having to delete everything and start over when things change. It was the reality for our users until we designed a more flexible solution.</p>
								</header>

								<p></p>
								<h2>Context</h2>
								<p>In Funnel, users can manually upload data when an automated connection isn’t available or suitable for their use case. When uploading their data, the user has to set a configuration (specify fields, field types, etc.), which they also use when they upload future data to the same dataset. It’s also needed to ingest the data in a way that makes sense to the user.</p>
								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>After the user set the configuration for their new dataset, they couldn't change it. If, for example, the user wanted to change the name of a field or the field type, they would have to delete everything and start again. Alternatively, they could contact us, and we could try to make the changes from the backend. This process was extremely frustrating (and time-consuming) for our users and us, especially when the changes were minor.</p>
								<h2>The Idea</h2>
								<p>As you’ve probably guessed, we wanted to enable our users to edit the configuration. It would not only reduce their frustration and save them time but also reduce the amount of support questions and errands we received.</p>
								<h2>The Scope</h2>
								<p>There are a lot of things a user can edit in the configuration. Enabling our users to edit all these options from the initial launch would have meant a lengthy development process with our customers still struggling for a long time. We decided that starting with (and launching) one editable configuration option made the most sense.</p>

								<center><i> The manual data upload configuration in Funnel </i></center>
								</p></p>
								<h2>The Process</h2>
								<p>I started by reviewing old support conversations, feature requests, and system events to see if I could spot some patterns. It seemed that the need for adding and removing fields from the schema was the most common, but why?</p>
								<p>I decided to conduct a number of interviews with these users to understand the need more and further define the problem. I also included our developers in this process to help build empathy for our users and understand the scale of the problem.</p>
								<p>With a better understanding, we started work on the prototypes (in Figma). We wanted the solution to feel natural to the user and behave the same as the initial configuration setup. We created and tested three prototypes before moving forward with our solution.</p>

								</p></p>
								<p>We also spent a lot of time scenario mapping to understand and define how specific actions would affect configurations and datasets in different states.</p>

								</p></p>
								<h2>Launch and Conclusions</h2>
								</p>Since the users would only be able to edit one option initially, we took extra care when releasing the feature to set the right expectations. We also tried to eliminate any confusion around which options were editable.</p>
								</p>After launching the feature, we saw good adoption and usage straightaway. We also managed to reduce the number of support questions and errands for this part of the product by 50%.</p>
								</p>Over the coming weeks and months we continued closely monitoring, making usability improvements and adding additional editable options using a similar design and development process.</p>
								<h2>Reflections</h2>
								</p>After the initial release, there was still some confusion around which options were editable, which weren't, and if it would be possible to edit them in the future. We could have spent even more time on this before releasing it to make it more understandable.</p>
