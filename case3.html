									<h1>A Simplified Connection Process</h1>
									<p>When a page acts as a setup flow, an overview, and a workspace, it’s no surprise that users have a hard time finding what they need. The new design made life easier.</p>
								</header>

								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>When using Funnel’s file import feature, users had to navigate between several similar pages to complete their goals. Depending on the current phase, the same pages would change appearance, which added to the confusion.</p>
								<p>There were also two pages within the flow that displayed the same things, owned by two different teams in the organisation. The whole process was incredibly complicated.</p>
								<h2>The Idea</h2>
								<p>It was clear that we needed to simplify the following aspects of this feature:</p>
								<ol>
  								<li>Merge the two pages owned by separate teams and let one team own it</li>
  								<li>Uncouple the connection flow, overview, and workspace</li>
  								<li>Ensure pages that users revisited remain static so they can always find what they need</li>
								</ol>								
								<h2>The Scope</h2>
								<p>Due to it's size, we needed a different approach. I decided that breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces that we could release incrementally would be the best approach to ensure success.</p>
								<h2>The Process</h2>
								<p>I began by walking through Funnel, capturing hundreds of screenshots along the way. These screenshots provided visual support when I created user journeys to showcase the problems internally.</p>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/scp1.png" alt="" /></div> 
								<center><i> My workspace in FigJam </i></center>
								</p></p>
								<p>Next, I deconstructed the feature and built a prototype that embodied our ideal solution. User testing allowed me to compare the new prototype to the existing process and identify other areas for improvement.</p>
								<p>Confident in the new design direction, I divided it into smaller, independent tasks and ensured they wouldn't disrupt other functionalities. Each task offered individual value, regardless of whether the entire initiative was completed.</p>
								<p>Finally, I created GitHub issues for the developers within our team. I also included them throughout the process to ensure everyone was happy and agreed with the direction.</p>
								<h2>Launch and Conclusions</h2>
								</p>The first completed task yielded immediate results, with a dramatic reduction in clicks and session time. Following the completion of all tasks, the user experience underwent a complete transformation, becoming streamlined and intuitive. This resulted in a significant increase in completion rate, while simultaneously lowering support requests and abandoned sessions. Notably, we even received unsolicited positive feedback from customers praising the improved experience.</p>
								<h2>Reflections</h2>
								</p>This initiative reinforced the value of setting ambitious, long-term goals and breaking them down into achievable steps. It’s much more rewarding than only focusing on the problem at hand.</p>
