									<h1>Increasing Operational Efficiency</h1>
									<p>It's no fun when a team gets bogged down with simple customer requests. The solution we designed enabled them to focus on more complex problems instead.</p>

								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>There's a team of integration engineer superstars at Funnel that create custom connectors for Funnel's customers when the core offering and self-service tools fall short.</p>
								<p>The demand for their services was quickly growing, and they found themselves spending vast amounts of time on more simple requests instead of being able to focus 100% on the trickier cases.</p>

								<h2>The Idea</h2>
								<p>We believed that expanding Funnel’s self-service offering would offload Integration Engineering, freeing their time and empowering users to obtain the data they need independently, eliminating the need to contact us and wait for custom solutions.</p>							
								<h2>The Scope</h2>
								<p>We decided that focusing on the most common smaller requests, which provided the most customer value and made the most sense as a self-service tool, was the place to start. We just had to figure out what that was.</p>
								<h2>The Process</h2>
								<p>We started by meeting with Integration Engineering and reviewing the incoming requests and the connections they were building. We found that ZIP files sent via email were the most requested and developed within this category. We already had a self-service tool that ingested emails, but the feature didn’t support ZIP files. It was the perfect low-hanging fruit.</p>
								<p>I designed and hosted a workshop for the self-service team where we outlined the problems, requirements, and things we thought were necessary for the first version.</p>

								</p></p>
								<p>I then began work on the prototypes in Figma. From a UI perspective, the main focus was how the ZIP files would be displayed and expanded to the user. I acknowledged the potential benefits of user testing, but in this case, I decided to prioritise internal testing given the straightforward nature. After fine-tuning the prototype, we got to work on the build.</p>

								<h2>Launch and Conclusions</h2>
								</p>Shortly after launching ZIP support for the self-service tools, Integration Engineering’s total workload decreased by 20%! It enabled them to spend more time on complicated cases. We continued to monitor the feature, made further improvements, and looked for more ways to free up time for Integration Engineering.</p>
								<h2>Reflections</h2>
								</p>During the later stages of the development process, I realised that the Integration Engineering team wasn't included in our initial workshop. While obtaining customer insights is standard practice for me, I believe this oversight slipped through since the customer was also an internal team in this case. I made sure to follow-up with them before launching the feature.</p>
