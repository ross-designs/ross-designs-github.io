									<h1>Who uses<br />
									Funnel?</h1>
									<p>Understanding who your customers are is crucial when designing a product.<br />
									I helped create empathy and a joint view of Funnel’s customers by designing user personas.</p>
								</header>

								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>The marketing team was working on Funnel’s positioning, and they needed a better understanding of our existing customer segments, their thoughts, behaviours, goals and attitudes. At the same time the sales team were releasing playbooks for sales and customer success, but they were lacking customer attributes.</p>
								<h2>The Idea</h2>
								<p>We decided that creating buyer personas would be the most effective way to solve these problems, but also create a common view of our customers and create empathy for them at a company wide level.</p>
								<h2>The Scope</h2>
								<p>We focused on our existing customer/buyer segments, not new ones. We wanted to keep it simple and small, then build upon and iterate in the future. Our biggest fear was creating buyer personas that were not used at all, or used forever and not revisited and kept up to date.</p>
								<h2>The Process</h2>
								<p>We started by collecting our internal thoughts and preconceptions about Funnel’s customers by conducting a number of interviews and workshops with internal sales people across our global offices.</p>
								<p>We met with the project stakeholders (key members of the marketing and sales departments) to understand what they wanted to learn and questions they wanted to answer. These questions included:</p>
								<ul>
  								<li>What is the customer's perception of Funnel within their buyer journey?</li>
  								<li>What other tools would they have used if Funnel did not exist?</li>
  								<li>What challenge(s) are they trying to solve when purchasing Funnel?</li>
								<li>What's the context that affects the customer’s decision?</li>
								<li>What do they feel, think and do?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We then set up and conducted a large number of qualitative interviews with customers that had recently bought Funnel. We also dug into our CRM platform to learn more about our customers and their use cases.</p>

								<h2>Launch and Conclusions</h2>
								<p>After an extensive research period, we managed to identify and create 5 distinct buyer personas. This created a clear picture of our customer base for our marketing and sales team.</p>
								</p>We then marketed the personas internally by hosting presentations, creating and printing persona cards, hanging posters around the office, and appearing in segments of our company meetings.</p>
								</p>This resulted in the buyer personas being used across the company. They were referenced in meetings, internal workshops, different initiatives, and in daily conversations. As a company we started thinking more about the individuals, their struggles, hopes and wishes.</p>
								<h2>Reflections</h2>
								</p>After the buyer personas had been adopted across the company, it became clear that people were using the buyer personas as user personas. The people that buy Funnel aren’t always the people that use Funnel, so we should have made this much clearer when presenting and distributing the personas.</p>
								<h2>User Personas</h2>
								</p>Following the success of the buyer personas (and buyer personas being mistaken for user personas), we decided to create user personas using a similar design process. We managed to find links between the buyer and user personas, and also identified user segments which should be prioritised to minimise churn risk. These personas were also adopted by the company very quickly and are still used and updated to this day.</p>
