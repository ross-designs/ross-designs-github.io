									<h1>Who uses<br />
									Funnel?</h1>
									<p>Understanding who your customers are is crucial when designing a product.<br />
									I helped create empathy and a joint view of Funnel’s customers by designing user personas.</p>
								</header>

								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>The marketing team was working on Funnel’s positioning, and they needed a better understanding of our existing customer segments, their thoughts, behaviours, goals and attitudes. At the same time the sales team were releasing playbooks for sales and customer success, but they were lacking customer attributes.</p>
								<h2>The Idea</h2>
								<p>We decided that creating buyer personas would be the most effective way to solve these problems, but also create a common view of our customers and create empathy for them at a company wide level.</p>
								<h2>The Scope</h2>
								<p>We focused on our existing customer/buyer segments, not new ones. We wanted to keep it simple and small, then build upon and iterate in the future. Our biggest fear was creating buyer personas that were not used at all, or used forever and not revisited and kept up to date.</p>
								<h2>The Process</h2>
								<p>We started by collecting our internal thoughts and preconceptions about Funnel’s customers by conducting a number of interviews and workshops with internal sales people across our global offices.</p>
								<p>We met with the project stakeholders (key members of the marketing and sales departments) to understand what they wanted to learn and questions they wanted to answer. These questions included:</p>
								<ul>
  								<li>What is the customer's perception of Funnel within their buyer journey?</li>
  								<li>What other tools would they have used if Funnel did not exist?</li>
  								<li>What challenge(s) are they trying to solve when purchasing Funnel?</li>
								<li>What's the context that affects the customer’s decision?</li>
								<li>What do they feel, think and do?</li>
								</ul>
